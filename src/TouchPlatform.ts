// on tablets i want to draw smth like joystick imitation (on the left, or on the right side).
// Plus add mouse imitation (buttons left+right) + may be space (jump?) + may be more, dunno
// to know where to fire skill or smth like that
// - control the speed by the displacement of the joystick? hm. For keyboard increase the speed by respecting the 'repeat' property?
